There are some games that were played by virtually everyone you talked to.
_Prince of Persia_ was one of them, _Doom_ is another. For us, one of these
games _Letadlo_. The game was quite simple - a bomber plane descends while
traversing the screen from left to right. The player controls the bombs and
the guns of the plane and their goal is to destroy the city before the plane
crashes into it.

However, we consider destroying cities - surely full of innocent people -
immoral and inhumane. So we moved the game below the water surface and replaced
the city with stacks of barrels full of toxic waste.

### History

One day, we thought it would be a great idea to try out, how much of a game we
could create during one afternoon. Due to some technical issues, it took us two
afternoons, but in the end, we had something playable. We uploaded an archive
to our web site and forgot about it. To our surprise, we found our prototype a
few months later reviewed on one of the Czech freeware game portals. They gave
it a terrible score and complained that the game feels very unfinished - and
they didn't even mention us as the authors.

That motivated us to get back to the game and make a version we wouldn't mind
seeing played and reviewed. We rewrote the code from scratch, replaced the
original greenish graphics, added animations, sounds, menus, bubbles, and we
released the game for Windows in November 2002. 

### Retrospective

The final version of the game appeared on
most Czech freeware and download portals, and also on some CDs and DVDs bundled
with Czech game magazines. After some time, it also appeared on at least one
German game portal - the traffic they generated almost got us kicked out of our
hosting.

Overall, we estimate that the game was downloaded at least 10,000 times but the
overall number of people who played the game could be even higher. We got some
fan e-mails from players! And someone actually made a [conversion to Atari
800XL](http://abbuc.de/~bunsen/OcDetox.html). How crazy is that?

It has been a long time since the game was released. Since we have learned a lot
about coding, graphics, and design (e.g. that we should not put dark blue text
on a black background), but _Ponorka_ still has a special place in our hearts.
If you would like to be part of the nostalgia, you can [download the game from
Itch.io](https://trionteam.itch.io/ponorka) - it still runs on Windows 10.
