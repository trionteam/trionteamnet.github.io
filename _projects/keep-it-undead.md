Keep It Undead is a puzzle/strategy game where you need to make sure that the
zombie apocalypse virus survives even as people heal. The Ludum Dare version
has five levels, each with a unique puzzle based on a new game mechanic. We
developed the game with our long-time friend
[PCMaster](http://pcmaster.koinbahd.com).

The first version of the game was created over a weekend (and the following
Monday) for [Ludum Dare 46](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46). The topic
of this jam was "Keep It Alive". For some reasons, this inspired us to think
about a tower defense game. Given the state of the world in April 2020, zombie
apocalypse was an obvious theme too.

As we were discussing the idea, we converted to a reverse tower defense because
we really liked the idea of directing zombies to take over the guard posts. And
after building a prototype and the first levels, the puzzle-style gameplay
actually felt good, and we never got to adding those towers.
