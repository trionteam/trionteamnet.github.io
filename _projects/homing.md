Homing is an infinite runner where you need to take cover and avoid homing
missiles using your self-balancing personal transportation device. The game has
several types of obstacles and it supports local multiplayer for people who
prefer to avoid homing missiles with their friends.

We came up with the idea and developed the first version at [Global Game Jam
2019](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/homing). The theme of the jam was
_Home_. We found some interesting definitions of what home means on the
internet, but we couldn't find good mechanics that would go with them (that we
could implement over one weekend). Out final interpretation of the theme was
quite broad, on the other hand, at the end of the game jam, we had a demo that
was fun to play.

The global game jam version had the basic game mechanics, but we felt that we
could push the game further. We continued working on the game even after the
game, and added more features like the local multiplayer mode, added new
obstacle type, fixed rendering for ultrawide screens and more. Now the game
feels mostly complete - we could add more of everything, but none of these
would be fundamental changes to the gameplay.

We released homing more than fifteen years after our last game, but we had just
as much fun making it. Or maybe even more - all the experience we got through
the years paid off and turned into a lot smoother process. We're looking
forward to making more such games in the future - and we hope it won't take
another 15 years.
