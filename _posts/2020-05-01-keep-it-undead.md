title: New project - Keep It Undead
---
We participated in the [Ludum Dare 46
Jam](http://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46), teamed up with our friend
[PCMaster](http://pcmaster.koinbahd.com), and created a new puzzle/strategy
game [Keep It Undead](/projects/keep-it-undead.html). You can [download the
game or play it in the browser](https://trionteam.itch.io/keep-it-undead) on
Itch.io.
